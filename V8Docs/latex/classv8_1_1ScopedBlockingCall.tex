\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This class is instantiated with Create\+Blocking\+Scope() in every scope where a blocking call is made and serves as a precise annotation of the scope that may/will block. 

May be implemented by an embedder to adjust the thread count. CPU usage should be minimal within that scope. Scoped\+Blocking\+Calls can be nested.
